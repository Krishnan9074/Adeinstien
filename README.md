Welcome to the **Adeinstien** project! This repository contains the codebase for an innovative AI-powered system designed to enhance online shopping experiences through personalized product recommendations and automated video ad generation.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project utilizes advanced AI technologies to monitor user interactions on a simulated Walmart website, generate tailored product recommendations, and create dynamic video ads. These ads are then automatically deployed to platforms like YouTube and displayed on Walmart's digital screens and website.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time User Interaction Monitoring:** Track and analyze user behavior on the website to enhance personalization.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Leverage Conservative Q-learning, Jaccard and Cosine similarity algorithms, and reinforcement learning to provide customized product suggestions.
- **Automated Video Ad Generation:** Use generative AI to create engaging video ads, which are then distributed through short-form content platforms like reels and shorts.
- **Seamless Integration:** Display personalized ads across YouTube, Walmart's in-store TVs, and other social media website.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Flask
- **AI Pipelines:** Python (including Conservative Q-learning, Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI)

üß† AI Pipeline Details
- **Recommendation Engine:** Utilizes Conservative Q-learning, Jaccard, and Cosine similarity algorithms to provide highly relevant product suggestions.
- **Ad Generation:** Leverages generative AI to create scripts, convert them to audio using TTS, and compile images into video ads, which are then automatically distributed over several social media platform.
